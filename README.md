# helix-chatbot
A chatbot for a school, allowing anyone to access anything, from marks to name. Traversing data now made fun.

We have used the Python library "chatbot" to implement a simple chatbot, and I named it Helix.


Helix can return individual values from fields such as Name, Roll Number, Grade etc.
Helix can also point out the highest and lowest grade from the dataset.
